# Global COVID-19 Data


The idea of this repository is to 'normalize' COVID-19 datasets with population data to create standardised 100K per capita 'rates', making it possible to directly compare the rate and intensity of COVID outbreaks, past and present across the world.



### Data Sources:

Are provided along with an explanation of the data, along with any statistical warnings in the **README** files accompanying the datasets.


_The dataset will be updated daily by an automated process, (exact update time to be confirmed)_
