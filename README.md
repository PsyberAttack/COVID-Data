# Global COVID-19 Data

This is a developing dataset that aims to create a uniform measure by which to compare the severity of COVID-19 outbreaks. The idea is to normalise COVID-19 data with Population estimates to create comparable per capita 'Rates' to calculate intensity and speed of spread in similar sized regions.


### Syntax

1. **Rate** is a per capita calculation of Cases and Deaths per 100K population, (unless explicitly signposted).

2. **Infected(%)** is the percentage of Total Cases / Population over the period of the pandemic.

3. **CFR(%)** is the percentage of reported cases divided by the number of reported deaths.


### Data Sources:

Are provided along with an explanation of the data and any statistical warnings in the **README** files accompanying the datasets.


_The dataset will be updated daily by an automated process, (exact update time to be confirmed)_
