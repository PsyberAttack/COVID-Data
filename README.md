# Global COVID-19 Data

This is a developing dataset that aims to create a uniform measure by which to compare the severity of outbreaks across the globe.

### Syntax

1. **Rate** is a per capita calculation of Cases and Deaths per 100K population.

2. **Infected(%)** is the percentage of the population reported with a positive test.

3. **CFR(%)** is the percentage of cases reported that have led to reported deaths.



_The dataset will be updated daily by an automated process, (exact update time to be confirmed)_



## International COVID Data

Includes data from Johns Hopkins University COVID-19 data, enriched with population data from the United Nation

### Data Sources:

**Johns Hopkins University CSSEGIS:** https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19

**Populations calculated from:** https://population.un.org/wup/DataQuery/




## US COVID Data

Includes data from the New York Times COVID-19 dataset, enriched with population data from the US Census to create a uniform measure to compare outbreaks across the USA. State data is per 100K population, and is directly comparable to International data. County data Rates are per 10K population

### Data Sources:

**NYT Covid Dataset:** https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data

**Populations calculated from:** https://github.com/COVID19Tracking/associated-data



## UK COVID Data

Includes data from the UK Government, Office for National Statistics, National Records of Scotland and the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency enriched with population data from the Office for National Statistics. Rates are all calculated per 100K population, so the data is directly comparable. County data Rates are per 10K population. 111 Calls are phone call 'triages' of 'suspected' COVID cases. These do not directly correlate to positive tests, but provide a warning system for outbreaks. The case data is released daily for each Local Authority, but does not seem to stabilise for at least 2 days, so don't draw conclusions on the latest days of data.
