# International COVID Data

This repository includes data from Johns Hopkins University COVID-19 data, enriched with population data from the United Nations to create a uniform measure to compare the severity of outbreaks across the globe.

2. **Infected(%)** is the percentage of the population reported with a positive test.

3. **CFR(%)** is the percentage of cases reported that have led to reported deaths.
