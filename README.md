# Global COVID-19 Data

*** THIS  DATASET IS IN PROGRESS ***

The idea of this repository is to 'normalize' COVID-19 datasets with population data to create standardised 100K per capita 'rates', making it possible to directly compare the rate and intensity of COVID outbreaks, past and present.


The objective is to make data from credible sources, (such as Johns Hopkins University, New York Times and BRASIL IO), accessible to people who's technical level is to copy the data from their Web Browser into Excel. Too many smart people are precluded from access to data because they can't process the volumes of data required,or they can't be bothered because my god is it a hassle, so this project succeeds if it manages to help bridge that gap.


Those generating the data in this repository do so in the hope that the most inquiring minds will review it, so in the next days these Wiki pages will evolve to explain the syntax used, data formats and how to access the data. I'll also put some basic videos of how to use spreadsheets to analyse amd compare the datasets on my YouTube channel.
