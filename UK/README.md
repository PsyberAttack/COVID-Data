## United Kingdom COVID-19 Data

Includes data from the UK Government, Office for National Statistics, National Records of Scotland and the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency enriched with population data from the Office for National Statistics. Rates are all calculated per 100K population, so the data is directly comparable.

### Syntax

1. **Rate** is a per capita calculation of Cases or Deaths per 100K population.

### Files

**UK_Nations_Cases_Deaths.csv** provides case and death data for each of the four UK Nations.

**UK_Cases_LTLA.csv** provides a time series of case data for each UK Lower Tier Local Authority, (LTLA). It is updated daily, but the data does not stabilise for at 2-3 days because the report is generated by *"Specimen Date"*, (date the test was taken), rather than by *"Reported Date"*, (date when the test was processed).

**UK_Statistics_Agencies_Deaths.csv** includes 'suspected' and 'confirmed' COVID deaths from the Statistics Agencies of each of the four nations of the UK. The data is reported with a lag, but the number of deaths recorded is significantly higher than the official UK government figure because it includes people who have COVID-19 on their death certificates.

The *Office for National Statistics*, (ONS), provides the data for England and Wales, whilst *National Records of Scotland*, (NRS), provides a separate report for Scotland and Northern Ireland reports through *Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency*, (NISRA).
