## UK COVID Data

Includes data from the UK Government, Office for National Statistics, National Records of Scotland and the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency enriched with population data from the Office for National Statistics. Rates are all calculated per 100K population, so the data is directly comparable.

**Latest_111_Calls.csv** is a time series of phone call 'triages' of 'suspected' COVID cases. These do not directly correlate to positive tests, but provide a warning system for outbreaks. They are reported by CCGs, which overlap Local Auhorities, so they are not directly comparable.

**Latest_CASES_LTA.csv** a time series of case data for each Local Authority, updated daily, but it does not stabilise for at least 2 days, so do not draw conclusions on the latest days of data.

**UK_Death_Certificate.csv** is a combination of 'suspected' and 'confirmed' COVID deaths from the Statistics Departments of each of the 4 Nations of the UK. The ONS provides data for England and Wales, whilst Scotland provides separate data through NRS and Northern Ireland reports through NISRA. Updates are provided on Tuesdays, Wednesday's and Friday's respectively.
