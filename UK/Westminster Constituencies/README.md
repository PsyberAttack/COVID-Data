## COVID-19 Cases by Parliamentary Constituency

Includes data from the PHE COVID-19 Dashboard, ONS and House of Commons Library


### Methodology:

Westminster Constituencies are linked to their MPs and the Lower Tier Local Authority, (LTLA), using ONS lookups, then combined with COVID case data published daily by Public Health England for each LTLA. This is then combined with House of Commons Library data to include the MP's majority, the local 2nd Party and whether the seat changed hands at the General Election in 2019.

Cases rates are calculated Per Capita, (100K residents), and the the 7 day rolling sum is calculated from the Specimen Date. A 3 day lag is ued to compensate for test processing and turnaround times. The "Change Rate" is the increase/decrease of the rolling sum from the previous day.

Some Constituencies will cover more than 1 LTLA, whilst some LTLAs have more than 1 Constituency. If the Constituency and LTLA intersect they are recorded, although in some cases the intersection can be small, (as little as a few Wards). The ONS lookup table in the Data Sources section can be used to assess the amount of crossover between Constituencies and LTLAs in greater detail.

The City of London LTLA, (in the Constituency of Nickie Aiken, Conservative), and the Isles of Scilly LTLA, (in the Constituency of Derek Thomas, Conservative), are not included as their COVID data is recorded under other areas. Both MPs are still included with their larger LTLAs.
