## British Government COVID-19 Data

Includes data from the UK government and Devolved Administrations' COVID-19 dashboards. Some data is taken from an experimental dashboard and may change/stop. Data is currently versioned by Date to enable checks if data unexpectedly alters.

This dataset will be updated to include daily cases and deaths per region in the near future.


### Syntax

1. **CFR(%)** is the percentage of Total Cases / Total Deaths.



### Files:

**Total-CasesDeaths_LTA-[DATE].csv** includes Case and Deaths per local authority, as published by the UK Government COVID-19 Dashboard on the date of the file. Deaths for Scotland and Wales have not been published, and if this functionality isn't added then this file will be updated from the Devolved UK Administrations' reporting data.

**Latest_Cases_LTA-[DATE].csv** includes daily Case data per English local authority, as published by the UK Government COVID-19 Dashboard on the date of the file. I will update the dataset to include regional data from the Devloved Administrations in the near future.
