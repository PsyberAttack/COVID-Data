## New York Times COVID-19 Data

Includes data from the New York Times COVID-19 dataset, enriched with population data from the US Census to create a uniform measure to compare outbreaks across the USA.



### Syntax

1. **Rate** is a per capita calculation of Cases or Deaths per 100K population for States, and per 10K population for Counties.

2. **Infected(%)** is the percentage of Total Cases / Population over the period of the pandemic.

3. **CFR(%)** is the percentage of Total Cases / Total Deaths.




### Files:

**States.csv** includes State level data. Rates calculated per 100K population to be directly comparable to International data.

**Counties.csv** includes County level data. Rates are calculated per 10K population so caution should be taken when directly comparing them with larger populations.
