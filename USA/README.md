## New York Times COVID-19 Data

Includes data from the New York Times COVID-19 dataset, enriched with population data from the US Census to create a uniform measure to compare outbreaks across the USA.  

### Syntax

1. **Rate** is a per capita calculation of Cases and Deaths per 100K population.

2. **Infected(%)** is the percentage of the population reported with a positive test.

3. **CFR(%)** is the percentage of cases reported that have led to reported deaths.



### Files:

**States.csv** includes State level data. Rates calculated per 100K population to be directly comparable to International data.

**Counties.csv** includes County level data. Rates are calculated per 10K population so cautiion should be taken when directly comparing them with larger populations
